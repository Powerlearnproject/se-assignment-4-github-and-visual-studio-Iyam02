Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers? 

*******

    Version Control:
    Version control is a system that helps you manage changes to your project's files over time. It keeps track of every modification.

    Git:
    Git is a distributed version control system. It means that every developer has a complete copy of the project history on their local machine. 
    
    Here are some key features:

    1. Track Changes: 
    Git records changes to files, so you can see what was changed, who changed it, and when.

    2. Revert Changes: 
    If something goes wrong, you can revert to a previous version of the project.

    3. Branching and Merging:
    You can create branches to work on new features or fixes separately from the main code.
     


    How GitHub Enhances Version Control for Developers
    ==================================================
    GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. 
    It enhances Git by providing a centralized place where developers can store, manage, and collaborate on their projects. 
    
    Here's how GitHub enhances version control:

    1. Central Repository: 
    GitHub hosts your Git repositories online, making it easy to share your code with others.

    2. Collaboration Tools: G
    itHub provides tools like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, which facilitate collaboration among team members.

    3. Backup and Availability: 
    Your code is stored in the cloud, ensuring it's backed up and accessible from anywhere.
    
    4 Documentation and Project Management: 
    GitHub allows you to add README files to manage and document your projects effectively.
